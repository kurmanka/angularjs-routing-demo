== What is this?

This is a little demo of an AngularJS-based 3-page website, 
with AJAX-loading of the pages and direct links to each page 
(with #fragment URLs).

 * AngularJS: http://angularjs.org/

It demonstrates the use of the Angular Routes.

 * AngularJS ngRoute module: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute

It uses Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styles.

 * http://getbootstrap.com/

Also, the site demonstrates one way to make the current page 
link highlighted in the navigation. This is done via ng-class
directive of Angular. (Probably not the most elegant way to 
implement this.)

 * AngularJS ngClass http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngClass


I've used yeoman and bower to produce this demo.

 * Yeoman http://yeoman.io
 * Bower https://github.com/bower/bower

(Both are great tools that I recommend.)
