# What is this?

This is a little demo of an AngularJS-based 3-page website, 
with AJAX-loading of the pages and direct links to each page 
(with #fragment URLs).

 * AngularJS: http://angularjs.org/

It demonstrates the use of the Angular Routes.

 * AngularJS ngRoute module: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute
 * ngView directive: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute.directive:ngView

Also, the site demonstrates one way to make the current page 
link highlighted in the navigation. This is done via ng-class
directive of Angular. (Probably not the most elegant way to 
implement this.)

 * AngularJS ngClass http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngClass

Additionally, the demo uses Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styles.

I've used yeoman and bower to produce this demo.
